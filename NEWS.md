### CryptoKitties v2.0 - From Ethereum to Flow (Blockchain) - Build In Public

> Welcome to the early stages of our grand meowgration to Flow. 
> We want to enable mainstream adoption of the mascot of blockchain through free to play, new mechanics, 
> upgradable smart contracts, easy on-boarding, fewer limitations and restrictions, 
> and yes, fully composable, extensible on-chain layer one Kitties with true utility.
> Phew, that was a lot but every bit of it matters.
>
> Our vision is to inspire the world to collect CryptoKitties.
>
> This board will contain ideas, implementations, and designs of all the new features we want to test and potentially bring to Flow.
> Let's put lot of emphasis on the word "test". These features are in various stages of development 
> as we work towards building the closed alpha of CryptoKitties on Flow.

  - > The Gene Science contract is responsible for the genetic structure of Kitties. 
    > Unlike CryptoKitties' math-based mutation pyramid, Gene Science on Flow uses a queryable lookup table to enforce breeding 
    > logic for mutating pairs.
    > 
    > Every known legacy mutation will be ported over to CryptoKitties on Flow and locked forever. 
    > While legacy mutations will remain untouched, we do want your Jaguar to be able to mutate 
    > with new CK on Flow genes while retaining its legacy mutation.
    >
    > A gene size of 10 bits will allow for 2^10 potential genes in a single locus.
    > 25 loci make up the CryptoKitties genome with the first 12 being reserved for legacy loci. 
    > We've also made changes in the technical implementation of mixgenes and the core Kitty structure to allow backwards compatibility.

### Wrapped CryptoKitties Lite Pa-purr

> NFTs suffer from lack of liquidity and have a tendency to have high spreads. These issues along with additional 
> complexity of understanding their respective markets makes speculating on NFTs difficult. 
> Many investors are left to do their own research and figure out what others have had years to learn. 
> Investing in NFTs remains challenging due to their non-fungibility and transaction costs on ethereum.
>
> Wrapped CryptoKitties ($WCK) was the first experiment to convert NFTs into ERC20s to enable easy trading on exchanges like Uniswap. 
> With WCK, any CryptoKitty, regardless of market value, could be “wrapped” into a ERC-20 token. 
> This breakthrough allowed CryptoKitties players to convert over 50 thousand Kitties to gain access to liquid markets.
>
> Enter Wrapped Gen-0 ($WG0) CryptoKitties. The motivation behind WGO is to provide easy access to liquidity 
> for a more valuable asset class with fixed supply. Only 50,000 Generation 0 cats can ever exist and much less are in circulation. 
> WG0 is a modification of the original experiment, with the additional requirement that the wrapped CryptoKitty must be a scarce Generation 0 cat.
>
> Deflationary supply Generation 0s is another variant that remains interesting for collectors and speculators.
> This asset class is called Virgin Generation 0 and Wrapped Virgin Generation 0 ($WVG0). 
> These Kitties are of mint quality and must remain unbred to keep their virginity.
>
> There are only two ways to get a WG0 token: wrap an existing Gen 0 kitty that you own, or buy one from Uniswap. 
> A WG0 token is always backed exactly 1:1 with a Gen 0 kitty, and at any time a holder of 1 WG0 token can "burn" 
> the token and withdraw any Gen 0 from the WG0 contract. This creates unique opportunities to arbitrage between CryptoKitties' 
> first-party marketplace and the WG0 pool as well as the ability 
> to upgrade any Generation 0 you may own with any Generation 0 in the pool.
